this project should allow a user to backup and restore to from more than one computer to maintain dotfiles or .config entries.
every dot file entry should be tagged with where it can be restored to for example you could have tags of home , work a dot file for work may not be usable at home.
the ui should be terminal based and use the charmbraclet ui's for ensuring a modern and clean interface in the terminal
there should be progress bars for each entry as its backing up or retoring 
you should be able to add for example a single file like ~/.wezterm
also a directory like ~/.config and the ui should read that provide a dsiplay of the directores and or files with a user friendly name for example .config/kitty should show kitty but also what that app is Kitty Term for example.
